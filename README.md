# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which include configurations for various applications and tools I use to enhance my workflow. These dotfiles are designed to help me maintain consistency across different environments and make my setup more efficient.

## Included Configurations

- **Browser (Brave)**  
   Customizations for the Brave browser, including a personalized theme, toolbar, vertical tabs, and pinned sites.  
   Detailed configuration and screenshots are included in the [Brave folder](./applications/brave).

- **Windhawk**  
   Personalization of the Windows Start Menu using the Windhawk tool. This allows me to customize the appearance and behavior of the Start Menu for a better user experience.  
   Configuration details can be found in the [Windhawk folder](./applications/windhawk).

- **Terminal**  
   Customizations for my terminal environment, including my `.zshrc` and other related configuration files to optimize my terminal usage.  
   These are located in the [terminal folder](./shell).

- **Git**  
   My personal Git configuration file (`.gitconfig`) that includes settings for aliases, behavior, and default options.  
   You can find this in the [git folder](./git).

## Notes

- Feel free to use these configurations as a reference or adapt them to your needs.
- Make sure to review the files carefully before using them, especially if you're replicating settings across different systems.
